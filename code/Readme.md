This `code` folder contains scripts and notebooks instrumental in understanding security incidents and academic research trends in the blockchain interoperability domain. The Jupyter notebook, "SoKI.ipynb," encompasses the content and analyses from the two R scripts, "distribution_studies_by_year.R" and "hacks_timeline.R," providing a unified, interactive platform for exploring cross-chain security incidents and research trends. Additionally, we provide the R script "systematic_literature_review.R" used to generate our PRISMA diagram depicting our systematic literature review.
