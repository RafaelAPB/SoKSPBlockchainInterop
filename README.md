    <strong>Incidence Response & Transaction Details</strong>
    This folder features two tables under "Incidence Response" and "The Hashes of Transactions and Addresses." The "Incidence Response" table offers an overview of various hacked bridges, highlighting initial transactions and public announcements. Names are color-coded, with Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) transaction details partly shown. The second table delves deeper, presenting complete transaction hashes and additional data, including Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC transactions, attacker addresses, and informative links. For full incident details, consult the <code>incident_response.md</code> and <code>txs_and_addresses_hashes.md</code> files.
